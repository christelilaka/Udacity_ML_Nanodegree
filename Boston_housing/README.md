# Boston Housing

## Model Evaluation & Validation

This is the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity. The goal of this project was to evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that was trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a _good fit_ could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:

- 16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.
- 1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.
- The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.
- The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.

The meaning of the three features is as follow:

- 'RM' is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.
- 'LSTAT' is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered "lower class" (working poor).
- 'PTRATIO' is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.
